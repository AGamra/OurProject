* code After completing the first stage of the workshop, we made observations that lead to
* improving the quality of the code. The aim of this is to implement what we have reached from the first stage.

* The project does that it improves the code and makes it understandable and readable, so this leads to the development of the bank's code and makes it better

* The benefit of this project, after its development, is to help developers of the system and code readers to understand it faster, and thus facilitate the release of updates continuously.

## Technologise Used 
* The code is written in Java which contains a lot of libraries that are in the JDK

## difficulties
* Users will find it difficult to understand the code, since the system is a bank system and its information is sensitive, so some classes and variables have been encrypted.

## Setup
* Dawnload npm 
* Dawnload Virtual machine
* Sign up github
* Creat Repository 
* Dawnloand code 
* Releas code
