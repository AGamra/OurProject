# Workshop2

## Description 
* The purpose of the workshop is to learn and apply the software engineering activities and skills needed.
*  It consists of four iterations of the implementation product (food text label predictions).
*  This workshop is based on the development of a web-based machine learning system for classification of simple text



## installation
* The following steps show you how to set up the node is the server to run the machine learning platform
 (Text Classification Quick Text Tool) on the example from the user.  In order to run the first version of the system, you need the following steps:
1. Download npm:
>  sudo apt install npm
2. Create and open project folder:
> mkdir [your choice name]
3. Initialize requirements:
> npm init -y 
4. Add index.html,index.js and train.txt in the same folder. [check the supplement materials]
5. Install the Node.js sandbox for the Machine learning algorithm (fasttext):
> npm install node fasttext --save
6. Install Express:
> npm install express --save
7. Install some cors issues:
> npm install cors --save
8. Now if you want to get this sandbox up and running pretty quick you go ahead and use my 
HTML and J's files (provided on this URL) and once you have done. 
9. Run index.js:
> node index.js
